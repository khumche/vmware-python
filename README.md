### NicChanger.py
Based on available sample scripts from

The script takes a CSV file with rows in the following format
"vmName,ma:ca:dd:re:ss,NetworkName"

After it connects to the vCenter or ESX host, tries to find the VMs, removes ALL the network interfaces currently used on the VM and creates a new Vmxnet3 interface with the given MAC address and connects it to the specified network on the vSwtich
